# 2023/2024 Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the 2023/2024 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

> Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar. It has been running since 2015. <br>
> The programming puzzles cover a variety of skill sets and skill levels and can be solved using any programming language. Participants also compete based on speed on both global and private leaderboards. <br>

I completed the puzzles for all 25 days of the 2024 AOC, and 13 days of the 2023 AOC. These solutions are all written in Python, with minimal dependence on third party libraries. Each puzzle solution is an individual Python program in its own directory. 

All of these programs can be run with Python 3.9 - 3.11. PyPy can be used to speed up some of the solutions. 

There is a helper program, `aoctool.py` which automatically downloads program inputs and sets up the working directory for the puzzle. This requires a `config.json` file in the root of the repository containing your browser cookies for `adventofcode.com`.
