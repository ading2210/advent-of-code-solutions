# 2023/2024 Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the 2023/2024 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

All of these programs can be run with Python 3.9 - 3.11. PyPy can be used to speed up some of the solutions. 

There is a helper program, `aoctool.py` which automatically downloads program inputs and sets up the working directory for the puzzle. This requires a `config.json` file in the root of the repository containing your browser cookies for `adventofcode.com`.
